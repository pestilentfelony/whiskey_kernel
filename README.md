#### Whiskey is a RISC-V Kernel built in Rust and Assembly.
#### It features literally nothing useful so far other than a cool yellow shell.

whiskey_kernel is a heavy work in progress, and aims to develop into a skeleton that can be built
upon by other fellow developers.

I guess you could call it GNU/whiskey. Yes, that was a funny joke.

#### Roadmap
1 -> Finish buddy allocator, (info in TODO)
2 -> define Userspace ABI (primarily a tiny syscall interface)
3 -> memory isolation, simple page table setup
4 -> replace tasks.rs with better process structure
5 -> storage support (read from a disk iamge)
5.5 -> simple read-only filesystem (w/dierctory table, some files)
6 -> add an elf loader to parse simple elf binaries
7 -> add syscall layer for writing, exiting (+ reading later)

#### Does this project use AI?
Yes and no. Pestilentfelony (Head developer) makes use of AI as advisory, and primarily to explain 
RISC-V assembly code. For other purposes, Pestilentfelony frowns upon it. This is for learning.
